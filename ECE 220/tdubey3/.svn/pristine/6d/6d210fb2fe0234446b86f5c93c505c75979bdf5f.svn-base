/* Object oriented programming in ANSI C!
   This framework effectively turns the surface struct into a class,
   with sphere, frustum, circle, and quad "flavors" inheriting from it.  Large
   projects (such as the Linux kernel) use conventions like this to do object
   oriented programming in C.

   How this works:
   Each surface maintains a "class" member which points to a structure which
   has all the specific functions for that class.  Each surface is also
   allocated some extra bytes of space to define the specific geometry
   of that surface.  This geometry data is passed to each specialized
   intersection function, which knows how to interpret it.

   How to initialize a surface:
   Set the class pointer to point to the appropriate surface class, one of
   surface_sphere, surface_frustum, surface_circle, surface_quad.
   Interpret the extra bytes as the appropriate structure, and fill it in.
